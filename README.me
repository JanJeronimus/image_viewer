# Image Viewer Repository
# Jan Jeronimus - 5 April 2024

## Description:
This repository contains multiple versions of an image viewer application built in Python using the tkinter library for GUI and the PIL (Python Imaging Library) module for image handling. Each version provides different functionalities or enhancements to the basic image viewer.

## Contents:
(Example)
1. `image_viewer_basic.py`: Basic version of the image viewer with buttons to load predefined images.
2. `image_viewer_dropdown.py`: Enhanced version with a dropdown menu to select images.
3. `image_viewer_with_menu.py`: Version with menu to select images.
4. `image_viewer_objects.py`: Version with images as objects.

## Usage:
Each Python script can be run independently by executing it with Python. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system along with the required libraries (tkinter and PIL).

### Running the Scripts:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the desired Python script.
4. Run the following command:
    ```
    python script_name.py
    ```
    Replace `script_name.py` with the name of the script you want to run.
