# ImageViewer with Dropdown Info

## Description:
`image_viewer02_with_dropdown.py` is an enhanced version of the image viewer application built in Python using the tkinter library for GUI and the PIL (Python Imaging Library) module for image handling. This version includes a dropdown menu that allows users to select images from a predefined list. When an image is selected from the dropdown menu, it is loaded and displayed in the viewer window.

## Features:
- **Dropdown Menu**: Provides a dropdown menu to select images from a predefined list.
- **Image Selection**: When an image is selected from the dropdown menu, it is loaded and displayed in the viewer window.
- **Button Functionality**: The buttons remain functional and can also be used to load images, similar to the basic version.

## Usage:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the required libraries (tkinter and PIL).
2. Save the `image_viewer02_with_dropdown.py` script in a directory.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
5. Run the following command:
    ```
    python image_viewer02_with_dropdown.py
    ```
6. The ImageViewer window will appear, allowing you to select images from the dropdown menu or use the buttons to load images.

## Note:
- Ensure that the image files referenced in the dropdown menu exist in the same directory as the script or provide the correct path to the images.
