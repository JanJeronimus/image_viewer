# ImageViewer Info

## Description:
The ImageViewer is a Python application built using the tkinter library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and the PIL (Python Imaging Library) module for handling images. It provides a simple interface for viewing images and includes buttons to load different images into the viewer.

## Usage:
To use the ImageViewer, you need to have Python installed on your system. You also need to have the tkinter and PIL modules installed, which you can typically install using pip.

## Functionality:
- **Load Images**: The ImageViewer allows you to load images by clicking on different buttons. Each button corresponds to a specific image file.
- **Display Image**: When an image is loaded, it is displayed within the application window.
- **Error Handling**: If the specified image file does not exist, the application displays an error message instead of the image.

## Requirements:
- Python
- tkinter library
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

## How to Run:
1. Save the provided code in a Python file, e.g., `image_viewer01_basic.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
4. Run the following command:
    ```
    python image_viewer01_basic.py
    ```
5. The ImageViewer window will appear, allowing you to interact with it.

## Example Usage:
Suppose you have images named `image1.png`, `image2.png`, `image3.png`, and `image4.png` in the same directory as the script. By clicking on buttons labeled "Button 1", "Button 2", "Button 3", and "Button 4", respectively, you can load and view these images in the application window.

## Note:
- Make sure that the image files (`image1.png`, `image2.png`, `image3.png`, `image4.png`) exist in the same directory as the script or provide the correct path to the images in the `load_image` function calls.
