# Image Viewer with Menu and Buttons Info

## Description:
`ImageViewerWithMenuAndButtons` is an enhanced version of the image viewer application built in Python using the tkinter library for GUI. This version includes both a menu and buttons for loading images. The menu allows users to select images to display, while the buttons provide an alternative way to load images quickly.

## Features:
- **File Menu**: Includes an "Exit" option to close the application.
- **Images Menu**: Contains items for showing each image from a predefined list.
- **Buttons**: Provide additional functionality to load images by clicking on them.

## Usage:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the required libraries (tkinter and PIL).
2. Save the `ImageViewerWithMenuAndButtons` script in a directory.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
5. Run the following command:
    ```
    python image_viewer_with_menu_and_buttons.py
    ```
6. The ImageViewer window will appear, allowing you to select images from the menu or use the buttons to load images.

## Note:
- Ensure that the image files referenced in the menu and buttons exist in the same directory as the script or provide the correct path to the images.
